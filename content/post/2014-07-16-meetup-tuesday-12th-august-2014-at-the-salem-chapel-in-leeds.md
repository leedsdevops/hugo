<p>It may be a lazy summers day but we've pulled together a cracker of an evening for you. Our next Devops meetup will take place at 6:45pm on Tuesday 12th August thanks to the generosity of our friends AQL at the Salem Chapel.</p>
<p>We've really done ourselves proud and got a couple of top notch speakers:</p>
<p>Fresh from ChefConf <strong>Justin Arbuckle</strong> the VP EMEA &amp; Chief Enterprise Architect Chef (formally Opscode) will be in attendance to talk about Accelerating the Enterprise Devops Journey (but don't worry this will include an overview of Chef).</p>
<p>We are also joined by regular attendee and all round good bloke <strong>Jon Milsom</strong> the Co-founder &amp; CTO of Pitchero who will be telling us about their infrastructure.</p>
<p><!-- more -->The venue is situated across the road from the Adelphi, so it's a doddle to find, in addition to the venue being part auditorium part server room there will as always there's a well stocked bar.</p>
