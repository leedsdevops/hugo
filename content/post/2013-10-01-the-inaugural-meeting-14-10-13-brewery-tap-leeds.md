<p>It's with great excitement we announce the inaugural meeting of LeedsDevops.</p>
<p>Here's a quick agenda....</p>
<ul>
<li>Short presentation about the group and proposed ideas.</li>
<li>Disscusion on what the group should be representing.</li>
<li>Ideas for future meetups including format and topics</li>
<li>Appeal for helpers, speakers, sponsors and publicity</li>
</ul>
<p>As this is the first meetup there's no "Technical Presentation" or "Speaker", it&rsquo;s much more informal getting the thing off the ground chat.&nbsp;A chance for the community to help decide on what we do in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>If you'd like to come then please grab a ticket over at <a href="https://leedsdevops.eventbrite.co.uk/">https://leedsdevops.eventbrite.co.uk/</a>&nbsp;and get yourself to The Brewery Tap (18 New Station Street, Leeds, LS1 5DL) on Monday 14th October 2013. Fun starts at 7pm, expect to be done about 8ish depending upon how long we natter on for.</p>
<p>Alternatively if you don't want all the eventbrite faff then ask us nicely on either twitter @leedsdevops or by email meetup @ leedsdevops.org.uk&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
