<p><p>We're extremely pleased to be running our next Devops meetup as part of <a href="leedsdigitalfestival.org/">Leeds Digital Festival</a>. To celebrate we will be meeting at The ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 26th April 2016 for an exciting evening of devops chat. Yet again we bring you a cracking line up: </p><ul><li>6:45 - 7:15 : Grab a beer, have a natter.<br></li><li>7:15 - 7:30 : Group updates/news/announcements<br></li><li>7:30 - 8:00 : Simon Davy - Canonical<br></li><li>8:00 - 8:15 : Intermission<br></li><li>8:15 - 9:00 : John Ewing - SkyScanner<br></li><li>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe<br></li></ul><!-- more --><p>It's a busy month for Canonical with the release of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, so we're delighted that Simon Davy will be joining us to tell all about Ubuntu Core (aka Snappy), a transactionally updated secure platform (both base OS and apps) which previews with the 16.04 release. This talk will be of special interest to those of you deploying to cloud or devices.</p><p>Then after many months of pleading and grovelling we are chuffed to bits to have John Ewing from SkyScanner talk at our event. </p><p>John is the squad lead for the Real Time Data squad at SkyScanner and he'll be talking about their move away from Graphite as a metrics platform and which tools they moved to, he'll be sharing the lessons learned from the experience.</p><p>Once again we are grateful to have <a href="http://www.infinityworks.com/">Infinity Works </a>sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening and ensuring the now legendary "ODI Fridge of Beer" is suitably full.</p><p><b>Venue</b></p><p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro house, on Duke Street. If you want to find out more about the ODI details can be found at http://theodi.org/nodes/leeds</p><p><b>Tickets</b></p><p>Tickets are free and are available over on eventbrite or meetup.com</p><p>http://leedsdevops-apr-16.eventbrite.co.uk/<br>http://www.meetup.com/LeedsDevops/<br></p><div style="width:100%; text-align:left;"><iframe src="//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=24409566671&amp;ref=etckt" frameborder="0" height="214" width="100%" marginheight="5" marginwidth="5" scrolling="auto"></iframe><div style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial; font-size:10px; padding:5px 0 5px; margin:2px; width:100%; text-align:left;"><a class="powered-by-eb" style="color: #dddddd; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/r/etckt">Powered by Eventbrite</a></div></div></p>
