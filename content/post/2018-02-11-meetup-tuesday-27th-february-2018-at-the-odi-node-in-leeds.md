<p><p>Happy new year! it’s time for the first devops get together of 2018 at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 27th February. We have a fantastic duo of talks for you:</p><p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br>7:25 - 8:05 : Building Pipelines with Kafka from Scratch - Ben Abramson and Robert Knowles of William Hill<br>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br>8:20 - 9:00 : Docker 101, Moby and K8s - Dan Finneran of Docker Inc<br>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p><!-- more --><p>First up we have from Leeds, Ben Abramson and Robert Knowles of William Hill. They will be talking about their experiences of building a Low-Latency, High-Throughput Pipelines with Kafka from Scratch. Covering the story of what they built, what went well, what didn’t go so well and what they learnt. This is a story of how a team of developers learnt (and are still learning) how to use Kafka. They hope that you will be able to take away lessons and learnings of how to build a data processing pipeline with Apache Kafka.</p><p>Then we are joined by Dan Finneran a Solutions Architect at Docker, Dan describes himself as someone who spent "Thirteen years of breaking and fixing IT Infrastructure (but mainly breaking) that led to the realisation that there have to be better ways of doing things. This talk will cover the how's and why's of the Docker Engine, orchestrating your container environment and some of the tools in the Moby Project that can provide immutable and scalable infrastructure", So wether you are completely new to container technology or an old hand there will be something for you to take away.</p><p>We are again grateful to have <a href="https://www.infinityworks.com/">Infinity Works</a> sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p><p><b>Venue</b></p><p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro House, on Duke Street.
