<p>This month we'll be at the Open Data Institute Leeds Node. Situated just around the corner from the BBC, Aagrah and the Wardrobe at the top of Munro House. <!-- more -->We decide we should really get somewhere that had space for us all (last month at the Adelphi was a little too "cosy"). So we have a great venue with a nice big screen, plenty of seating and panic not - a bar.</p>
<p>But the good news doesn't stop there, look at what we have for you this time....</p>
<ul>
<li>7:00 - 7:20 : Grab a beer, have a natter.</li>
<li>7:20 - 7:30 : Group updates/news/announcements from Andy Burgin</li>
<li>7:30 - 8:00 : Steve Melrose - "The Last Mile"</li>
<li>8:00 - 8:15 : Intermission</li>
<li>8:15 - 9:00 : Chris Reid - "DevOps, SDN and the Virtual world"</li>
<li>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speakers</strong></p>
<p>Yet again we've got a couple of cracking speakers, at the top of the shop we have Chris Reid, Chris's physical role focuses on the virtual world of orchestration and networking, helping companies understand and develop new propositions in this space. Chris is on the organising committee for Cloudstack's 2014 European conference and is speaking at the Network Virtualisation/SDN World summit in London later this month. Chris will be talking about building an ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) tool using DevOps practices and their application in Virtual Networks and Software Defined Networking.</p>
<p>Before that we have local developer Steve Melrose who will be talking about how building an application is only half the battle. Anyone who's taken an application from development to production will tell you it's not as simple as it sounds. This talk is centred around an application he recently built and deployed at Sky Bet. It focuses on some of the things that need to be done to put an application in production, namely monitoring and load testing, and the enablers around them.</p>
<p>We're very grateful to have a generous sponsor, the evening is sponsored by Tuleap -&nbsp; an opensource tool to help manage your applications lifecycle. So give it a quick test drive&nbsp;at &nbsp;<a href="http://www.tuleap.org/">http://www.tuleap.org/</a></p>
