<p>The third meet up of LeedsDevops took place at Leeds Central on Tuesday 14th January. We'd sold out the 25 tickets on eventbrite and we maybe could have had a few more people in the venue, so next time we'll look for a bigger venue.<!-- more --></p>
<p>After a quick recap of the groups aims and objective we had an insightful talk from Robin Harvey who is currently contracting at Orange Digital. He ran through his experiences of Devops and detailed the issues created by&nbsp;the fast evolution of cloud services.</p>
<p>Following a short break with a bar kindly sponsored by <a href="http://www.dubitlimited.com/">http://www.dubitlimited.com/</a> @andrewtaylor from Sage outlined his experiences and challanges faced in running a SAAS for a billion pound enterprise. Big thanks to the crowd for some intelligent questions, all of which were informatively answered by Andrew.</p>
<p>I've had nothing but positive feedback for the speakers and extra special ripple of applause is due to Andrew for not only taking the time out to travel down from Newcastle (getting home at daft o'clock) but for also funding the outing himself.</p>
<p>We've a busy couple of weeks coming up as we'll be presenting at Agile Yorkshire and a number of other local tech groups, so sign up for the mailing list <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/leedsdevops">https://groups.google.com/d/forum/leedsdevops</a> for all the latest news and discussion.</p>

<p>Next meetup Tuesday 25th February, details to follow</p>
