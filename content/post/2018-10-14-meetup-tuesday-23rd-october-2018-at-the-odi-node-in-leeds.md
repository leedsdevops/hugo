In late 2016 Simon moved into the world of platform engineering to help re-imagine Sky Betting &amp; Gaming's delivery approach and drive operational efficiency. Delivery agility is key to Simon and his Team's success. As their engineering team grows, they have an increasing number of greenfield products to comission, as well as monolithic applications to decompose into microservices. To manage this they need a platform that can keep pace, both in the cloud and on-premise. Simon will explore with you why they choose Kubernetes, how they're adapting both on AWS and on-premise and the challenges they faced.</p><p>As an extra treat we'll also be giving away 2 tickets for the upcoming <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-edinburgh/">DevOpsDays Edinburgh</a> conference on the 1st and 2nd of November.</p><p>Once again we say a massive "Thank You" to <a href="https://www.infinityworks.com/">Infinity Works</a> for sponsoring the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p><p><b>Venue<br></b>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro House, on Duke Street.
