<p>In a single day we've hit 50 followers on the @leedsdevops twitter account. Which is loads more than we ever expected - so thank you!</p>
<p>One very good question posed by @CraigPickles was...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link" href="https://twitter.com/leedsDevops">@<strong>leedsDevops</strong></a> so what exactly is your aim/ambition for this group/gathering? <a class="twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23intrigued&amp;src=hash">#<strong>intrigued</strong></a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption we've made here is that everyone already has basic understanding of what DevOps is and the kind of culture, skills and tools that it embraces. As a group that wants to encourage the adoption and use of these, we need to recognise that some people don't already know it all&nbsp;- and they are a very significant (but not wholly) reason for this group existing.</p>
<p>So yes people, it's time to scratch our heads and try to come up with a "manifesto" that covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is DevOps ?</li>
<li>How we communicate and encourage the use of the culture, skills and tools it brings.</li>
<li>Understand our follower/members/attendees - some may be knowledgeable and some may be Noobs</li>
</ul>
<p>So please chip in with your ideas, thoughts and opinions either on twitter or in the comments below.</p>
