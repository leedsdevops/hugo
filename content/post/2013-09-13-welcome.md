<p>Welcome to Leeds DevOps, the home of what we hope will become a hub for everyone in Leeds and the surrounding area with an interest in all things DevOps.</p>
<p>Whether you a Developer or in Operations (or both!)&nbsp;you're welcome to exchange ideas, tools, working practices or cultural shifts. Be that on here or via @leedsdevops let's get together and start sharing stuff.</p>
<p>The plan is to have a monthly meetup in the format of the existing groups in Leeds (@leedsphp, @leedsdatathing, node up north etc), where there is a presentation on a tool/idea/culture, followed by a healthy discussion possibly over a beer (or two).</p>
