<p>Even after releasing another 5 tickets for the meetup yesterday, we've still managed to give away 12 tickets yesterday - Big thank you folks, we're really chuffed.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>We've added a waitlist to the eventbrite page so if you still want to come but didn't manage to get a ticket put your name down and w can let you know if there are any cancellations.</p>
<p>If we get a big enough waitlist by Friday then we may&nbsp;need to look at getting a bigger venue.</p>
<p>So head on over to <a href="http://leedsdevops-jan-14.eventbrite.co.uk">http://leedsdevops-jan-14.eventbrite.co.uk</a> and&nbsp;add your name to the list.</p>
