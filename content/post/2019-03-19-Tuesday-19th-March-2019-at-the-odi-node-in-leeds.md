+++
Weâ€™re back at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 19th March 2019 for our Devops meetup, here's what we have in store for you:

* 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends
* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements
* 7:25 - 8:05 : Devoperability: Putting the Ops back into DevOps 
* 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission
* 8:20 - 9:00 : Reliability Engineering for Humans
* 9:00 - late : Social

Our first speaker of the night is Alexandra Moore. Alex has worked in IT, Marketing/Web design, Software Support and Software Delivery before moving into her current System Build (DevOps) role within TransUnion (formerly Callcredit). She spends her days making stuff better and says that a day without Metal and motor racing is a dull one.

We do "DevDev" really well, but are Ops people sufficiently engaged in 'DevOps' efforts and do we know what Operability means?  We seem to have moved the wall between Dev and Ops a little bit further to the right, instead of destroying it! 

Many larger organisations are guilty of this and TransUnion are not immune.  One of our greatest challenges is to encourage product teams to look not just at deploy-and-run-ability but also at long term operability of solutions.  I'll talk a bit about what operability means for us and how we can embed the right concepts early - with particular emphasis on understanding, testing and deployment.

Our headline speaker sees the welcome return of Hannah Foxwell. Hannah is delivery manager at Pivotal, where she helps teams transform how they deliver software. A HumanOps champion, a HugOps evangelist, and a DevOps believer, 

Her Talk "Reliability Engineering for Humans" discusses how the concepts and practices of site reliability engineering are changing the way we build and operate our platforms, enabling us to have more meaningful conversations about availability, service-level objectives, and cost. But what are the benefits for the engineer holding the pager? Can we add a human element to our error budgets?

### First Time Attendees
Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time atitendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch).

### Refreshments
We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) for their continued support and sponsorship.
