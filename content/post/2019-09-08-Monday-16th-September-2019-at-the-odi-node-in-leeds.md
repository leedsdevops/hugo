Our first speaker of the evening is James Healey, from Carbon DMP, talking about DevOps and Monitoring/Metrics. Carbon DMP is a Data Management Platform that aggregates millions of anonymous web browsing data points every day to deliver personalised advertising. James is a software developer at Carbon DMP, with a role encompassing both monitoring and DevOps.

James' talk will look at the full stack used by Carbon DMP across multiple cloud providers and container platforms, with special attention paid to monitoring and dashboards. 

Our second speaker is devops royalty Matthew Skelton. Matthew is the co-author of the book 'Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams For Fast Flow'. As Head of Consulting at Conflux, he specialises in Continuous Delivery, operability and organisation dynamics for software in manufacturing, ecommerce, and online services, including cloud, IoT, and embedded software.

His talk "Beyond the Spotify Model: using team topologies for fast flow and organisation evolution" covers the basics of organization design using Team Topologies, exploring a selection of key team types and how and when to use them in order to make the development and operation of your software systems as effective as possible. The talk is based on the forthcoming 2019 book Team Topologies and first-hand experience helping companies around the world with the design of their technology teams.

Matthew will be running a special training event on 26 Sept 2019 in Leeds on organisation design for modern software delivery - it's based on some material from the Team Topologies book. The training is useful for tech leaders, architects, team leads, and anyone else dealing with large-scale software delivery.

### First Time Attendees
Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people might be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We'll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don't want to join the discussion.


### Refreshments
We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, water, craft beer, cider and wine - a massive thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) for their continued support and sponsorship.
