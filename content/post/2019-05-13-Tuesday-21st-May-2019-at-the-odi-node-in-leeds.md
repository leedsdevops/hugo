We start this meetup with a different knid of talk, as we know a large part of devops is about creating a culture of trust, callaboration and empathy with our fellow colleagues. Alex Stanhope – Cloud Architect & DevOps Consultant from Lightenna in our first talk of the evening "Non Toxic Work Environments" describes that stress can be a fantastic healthy way to experience new challenges, grow and learn but without the right context, support and respite it can do real harm. In this session he'll look at the things we can all do to keep our workplaces happy and productive.

Our second talk of the night is a duo from DAZN, Mick Roper and Tom Lloyd. Mick is a Software engineer and architect with 10 years experience. Worked in businesses of all shapes and sizes and is the un-crowned king of the summer bbq. Tom is a engineer at Dazn with a background in functional Scala microservices and modular React apps. He has previously worked for Sky on their Sky Mobile launch, as well as their identity services. In his spare time, you’ll often find him on a mountain or watching old films.

Their talk "Serverless Chaos" discusses how chaos engineering is becoming a core competency required by teams to ensure that their users get the best experience of the product, but how do you apply chaos engineering approaches to Serverless architecture? In this talk they will explain the problem and demonstrate the solution to Serverless Chaos.

### First Time Attendees
Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We'll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don't want to join the discussion.


### Refreshments
We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, water, craft beer, cider and wine - a massive thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) for their continued support and sponsorship.
