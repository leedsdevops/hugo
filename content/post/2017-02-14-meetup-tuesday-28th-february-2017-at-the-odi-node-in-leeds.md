It's almost 8 years since the first Devops Days event and our thinking on tools, tech and culture has transformed the way modern software is built, delivered and run. But where is Devops heading? how are skills evolving ? what's the next big thing ? 
</p><p>
Our first talk sees the welcome return of James Hall from Parallax, he'll be explaining his hands-on experience with AWS Lambda for a project that crowd-sources the UEFA 2016 Anthem. He'll explain his take on the "serverless" movement and what gotchas his team ran into and how the service scaled quite happily to thousands of concurrent users without breaking a sweat. It's not perfect for every use case but he'll discuss when and where Lambda is a good solution to real-world problems.
