Creating a software development Value Stream Map is an exercise to identify delays caused by people, processes and tools. Over the past 12 months Marcus has been running DevOps focused "hackfests" with customers. Prior to each event we meet to create a Value Stream Map of the software development processes. In addition to improving understanding of the existing state the exercise enables opportunities for improvement to be identified.</p><p>During the session Marcus will describe Value Stream Mapping and the process carried out. Looking at a number of real world case studies and discuss some of the more interesting areas of waste that had been identified.</p><p>Hannah Foxwell describes herself as a long time member of London’s DevOps community, organiser of the HumanOps MeetUp, DevOpsDays London committee member. Wannabe adventurer, climber of mountains, HumanOps champion, HugOps evangelist, recovering DevOps consultant and craft beer nerd.</p><p>Building resilient systems is what we do and we do it well, but how much time do we spend working on our own personal resilience? In the ever changing world of technology, how do we ensure we are flexible, adaptable and resilient in the face of challenges and setbacks?</p><p>In this talk we’ll look at ways in which we can improve the resilience of our organisations, our teams and ourselves. Because if your team isn’t ready for change, your platform isn’t either.</p><p>Once again our friends <a href="https://www.infinityworks.com/">Infinity Works</a> have agreed to sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there is a plentiful supply of our favorite beverages, soft drinks and as it's Halloween a bumper supply of sweets!</p><p><b>Venue</b></p><p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro House, on Duke Street.
