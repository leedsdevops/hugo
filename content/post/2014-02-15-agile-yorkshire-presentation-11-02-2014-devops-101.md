<p>Last week we presented a "DevOps 101" talk to the fine people over at Agile Yorkshire.</p>

<p>We covered some of the "classic" definitions of DevOps from Adam Jacobs, John Willis and Damon Edwards, although the slightly sweary version from @lusis was perhaps the most well received.</p>
<p>We discussed the history of the movement and the principles it builds upon from Systems Thinking, Therory of Constraints and Lean, including a detailed look at how those are applied to CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing).&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally we finished off with some blatant promotion for the group and some really great questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Again thanks to Neil and Royd for inviting me and a ripple of applause to the headline speaker Seb Rose for a great talk on unit testing. I also had some great feedback and discussion (at least one person has bought the "Phoenix Project" on our recommendation).</p>
<p>The slides from the evening can be found on our github page:</p>
