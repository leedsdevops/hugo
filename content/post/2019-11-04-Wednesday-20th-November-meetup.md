### First Time Attendees
Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people might be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We'll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don't want to join the discussion.


### Refreshments
We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, water, craft beer, cider and wine - a massive thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) for their continued support and sponsorship.

### Venue
