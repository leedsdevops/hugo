Summer is upon us, what better way to spend a sunny summers evening than a does of DevOps chatter, on Tuesday 30th July 2019 we are at the ODI Node in Leeds for thought provoking devops ideas.

* 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends
* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements
* 7:25 - 8:05 : Paradigm Shift Left 
* 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission
* 8:20 - 9:00 : ECS, Fargate & the Power of Data MVT
* 9:00 - late : Social

Our first speaker of the evening is James Scanlan a tech lead in NHS Digital's Digital Delivery Centre. He has worked in the health sector for more than 20 years, focusing on delivering software systems that support the flow of data across health and care. Through a career that has spanned writing code, designing and architecting systems to technical and delivery leadership, James has a passion for providing high quality user centred solutions that work at scale. James spends most of his time thinking about technology, agile, devops and organisation culture! When not with his family or Dora (the dog) James can be found marching around North Yorkshire with some Explorer Scouts or getting carried away supporting Leeds United.

James says his talk "Paradigm Shift Left" is a bit of counter-programming for the evening. James is going to focus on the C in CALMS and talk about how culture underpins everything that effective devops teams are looking to achieve.

Our second speaker is Tim Edmonds who is a Digital Architect at Accenture, specialising in consumer-facing platforms for media & entertainment clients. With more than 15 years of experience engineering & architecting publishing and video systems around the world.

His talk "ECS, Fargate & the Power of Data MVT" is about how Accenture have migrated their micro-service estate to ECS using Fargate to help us scale for the peaks and troughs of video demand. Also how they used that same infrastructure to help them experiment and test different types data to improve the video consumption experience. 


### First Time Attendees
Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We'll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don't want to join the discussion.


### Refreshments
We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, water, craft beer, cider and wine - a massive thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) for their continued support and sponsorship.
