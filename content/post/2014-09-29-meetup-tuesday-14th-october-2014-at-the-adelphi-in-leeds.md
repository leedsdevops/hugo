<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the 14th October is not only the date of our next meetup, but is exactly one year to the day since we had our <a href="http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/65794783327/notes-from-inaugural-meetup">Inaugural meetup</a> to discuss if the group was worth forming. It was a small affair with about 6 of us upstairs at the Brewery Tap (infact we shared the room with Leeds Alopicia society separated by only a curtain). There was a general consensus that the group had a future, we then drank beer, and talked about devops, file systems and quadcopters, the rest is history.<!-- more --></p>
<p>So to mark the occasion we're returning from the ever luxurious surrounding of AQL's auditorium (and a big thanks to them for their support, I'm sure we'll be back at a future date) to the Adelphi (albeit in a bigger room than the Brewery Tap, but non the less a great boozer).</p>
<p>And to celebrate we've pulled out all the stops and got you a cracker of a night:</p>
<ul>
<li>First up we've Steve Elliot from LateRooms to tell us all about how they use elasticsearch, logstash and kibana to grapple with millions of lines of log data - its ELK Wrestling</li>
<li>Then at the top of the shop we've Aanand Prasad from Docker who'll be telling us all about docker, containers and how to keep them in check with fig.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also be fed and watered by our friends at <a href="http://contino.co.uk/">Contino</a>, if you missed our announcement last month they are a UK based consultancy specialising in DevOps and Continuous Delivery. They help organisations deliver better software, faster, by automating their infrastructure and releases, and getting key technology stakeholders collaborating together more effectively.</p>
<p>Tickets will be up for grabs on the 1st October at 9AM on <a href="http://leedsdevops-october-14.eventbrite.co.uk">eventbrite</a> or you can RSVP on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LeedsDevops/events/210539122/">meetup.com</a>, we're expecting them to go like hot cakes so keep an eye on twitter and if you've been before on your email.</p>
