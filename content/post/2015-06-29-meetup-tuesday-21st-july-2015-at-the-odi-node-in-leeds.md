<p>We're again at the Leeds ODI node on Tuesday 21st July 2015 for a jam-packed night of Devops related shenanigans. The itinerary for the evening will be...</p><ul><li>6:45 - 7:15 : Grab a beer, have a natter.</li><li>7:15 - 7:30 : Group updates/news/announcements</li><li>7:30 - 8:00 : Service Discovery - Flash Talking</li><li>8:00 - 8:15 : Intermission</li><li>8:15 - 9:00 : Desired State Configuration - Black Marble</li><li>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</li></ul><!-- more --><p>We really like a talk when it shares experiences, from how the team was setup to how a solution was delivered - including all the "fiddly" details. Marcell Jusztin from Flash Talking will be running through a talk on Service Delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li>- Monolithic applications vs SOA and microservices</li> 
<li>- Challenges in a service oriented environment (both operations and development)</li> 
<li>- What is service discovery? </li>
<li>- Consul (and other tools) </li>
<li>- Demo </li>
</ul>
<p>...so fingers crossed that the demo gods will be on their side :-)</p>

<p>As we plan these meetups, we're aware that we need to be diverse in the subject matter and tonight we've made a real effort to redress the Linux vs Windows balance. Thanks to our Devops Evangelist friends at Microsoft we've managed at long last to persuade Richard Fennell to come and talk. Richard is Engineering Director at Black Marble Ltd (Microsoft Gold Partner) he'll be sharing the ins and outs of Desired State Configuration (aka DSC). Richard summarises his talk as:</p>

<p><i>'In the Windows world, due to it API based architecture, deployment is too often not as simple as copying an EXE and updating a text configuration file. Desired State Configuration is an attempt to ease the pain we suffer in this space. Providing a set of tools that can be leveraged by any set of deployment tools whether in a Windows or heterogeneous environment. In this session we will look at what DSC is, what resource are available and how to write your own'.</i></p>

<p>For those of you from a Linux/BSD/OSX background it's a great opportunity to see what's new with other technology stacks.</p>
<p>We're also pleased to announce that <a href="https://www.brightbox.com">Brightbox</a> will be sponsoring our the evening, providing a roof above our heads and a generously stocked bar. </p>
