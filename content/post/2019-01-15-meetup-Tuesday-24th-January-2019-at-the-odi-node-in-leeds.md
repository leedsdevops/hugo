Happy new year, we've our first meetup of 2019 at The ODI Node in Leeds on Thursday 24th January 2019:

* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements
* 7:25 - 7:55 : Site Reliability Engineering: If it works for Google...
* 8:55 - 8:10 : Intermission
* 8:10 - 9:00 : The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey
* 9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe

Our first talk is from Sam Smith who is a Reliability Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming, his interests include graphs, data stores and not having to turn things off and on again at 02:00 whilst on call.

The talk is entitled "Site Reliability Engineering: If it works for Google..." 

...It might not work so well for you. That is, unless you adapt it.

- What is site reliability engineering (SRE) and how does it relate to DevOps?
- Why would you want to use SRE methods?
- How can we take these methods and implement them?

Sam will give a brief overview of what reliability engineering is and how it is different from "DevOps" along with some of the main pillars of SRE pactices. Next he will jump into a ongoing story of attempting to implement these practices at a non global scale.

This will touch on monitoring practices, incident response and post mortems and their place in the Service Reliability Hierarchy. Sam will relate this paper exercise to reality, what tools do we use and why? Which of these have worked well and which haven't. Expect a story or two of unfortunate DevOps accidents and how they could have been avoided with different practices and mindsets.

Finally Sam will talk about how you can start to organise for cultural change from your own team to get cross business buy in and change working practices for the better in your own work place.

Our second talk is from Mihaela Drumeva (Micky for short), ahead of her appearence at Config Management Camp she brings us a preview of her talk "The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey". Micky has a passion to automate all things. If she needs to perform a task more than twice, she'll automate it. Currently an operations engineer at Solarwinds, her 6 year career has spanned 3 companies and over 6 diverse teams, from development to test, build and infrastructure. As well as her day job as an operations engineer her main area of interest is in enhancing and automating new and exiting processes to increase productivity, confidence and quality. She recently organised Devopsdays Edinburgh and is passionate about building strong and diverse tech communities.

Micky will cover..

 - What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from unconventional background? 
 - How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles? 
 - How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management? 

Having started her first job as an operations engineer roughly 18 months ago, she had all of those questions and many more. Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.  She'd like to share the lessons she learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.
