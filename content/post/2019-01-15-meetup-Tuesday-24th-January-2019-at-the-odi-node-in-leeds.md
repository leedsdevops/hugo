* 8:55 - 8:10 : Intermission
* 8:10 - 9:00 : The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey
* 9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe

We're still dotting the i's and crossing the t's for our first speaker, but expect 30 mins filled with CI/CD, testing and the odd map! We'll update as soon as we have the everything sorted.

Ahead of her appearence at Config Management Camp, Mihaela Drumeva (Micky for short) brings us a preview of her talk "The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey". Micky has a passion to automate all things. If she needs to perform a task more than twice, she'll automate it. Currently an operations engineer at Solarwinds, her 6 year career has spanned 3 companies and over 6 diverse teams, from development to test, build and infrastructure. As well as her day job as an operations engineer her main area of interest is in enhancing and automating new and exiting processes to increase productivity, confidence and quality. She recently organised Devopsdays Edinburgh and is passionate about building strong and diverse tech communities.

Micky will cover..

 - What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from unconventional background? 
 - How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles? 
 - How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management? 

Having started her first job as an operations engineer roughly 18 months ago, she had all of those questions and many more. Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.  She'd like to share the lessons she learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.
