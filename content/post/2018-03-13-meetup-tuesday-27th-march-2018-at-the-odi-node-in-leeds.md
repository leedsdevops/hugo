Claire is the host of the popular ITSM Crowd hangouts, and Chief Architect for VeriSM.</p><p>In the last 5 years, the world of IT has exploded with buzzwords, new ways of working, and the ever present demands to do more with less. Digital transformation is the latest phrase, but what does it actually mean? Claire is going to talk about the changes that are needed at the personal and organisational level for digital transformation to actually deliver results, and how the VeriSM approach has been written to help.</p><p>Or second speaker is Bob Walker, Bob is one of the organising team behind DevopsDay London and claims to have been doing devops since before it was called devops and has been doing on call longer than that. bob is currently working at dxw as System Operations Engineer but has been the Supreme Ruler of the YAML engineers at the UK Government Digital Service and has only recently stopped being on call for GOV.UK.</p><p>Bob’s talk is "Questions you should ask at your "DevOps" interview" - Ever wondered how best to respond when an interviewer asks if you have any questions?
