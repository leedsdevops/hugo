<p>Ok, so we're looking for...</p>
<p><strong>Voices</strong> - to promote this group to whoever and however you can, but twitter might be a simple starting point, please retweet stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Hands</strong> - to help run the group, from posting stuff to twitter or tumblr, to organising meetups.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsors</strong> - we don't need a huge amount of cash, just enough to pay for the hire of the function room at a pub in Leeds, maybe a bit extra for a bite to eat and Beer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speakers</strong> - if we're going to have meetups we'll need something to talk about, be it cool stuff, practical stuff or opinionated rants - come and share your thoughts and ideas, 5 mins to 1 hour,&nbsp;length isn't important, it's what you do with it :-).</p>
<p>If you can help then get in touch via @leedsdevops or emailing "info at&nbsp;leedsdevops.org.uk" - be great to hear from you.</p>
