## Want to Speak at LeedsDevops ?

There are many interpretations of DevOps, but we see it as the combination of technology, people and organisations easing the practice of getting code into production (and living there). We're always looking for speakers to talk at the meetup on the aforemention topics, this could be a tutorial on using a technology or a case study sharing experiences and lessons learned - we're pretty flexible on the format, let us know if you want to do something different.

We are happy for vendors to come an talk and demonstrate products but it has to demonstrate real world practical application - any sales pitches won't be recived well by the community, so don't do them.

## The Audience

The crowd has a mixture of experiences, some are just starting their DevOps journey, others have be on it for years. Some of the atendees are technicalother are not. If you are clear in you talk description the audience will self select it's self, as long as your talk is DevOps related it'll be received really well.

We give away 100+ tickets for each meetup, typically we get 60 - 80 attend (it depends on many factors from weather to sporting fixtures - we really don't understand why), we know some of the less popular tracks at bid commercial conferences struggle to attract that level of attendance.


## Experience

We aren't expecting you to be a vetteran conference speaker, in fact we really like hearing new thoughts and ideas. If you feel confident enough to speak in front of the crowd we'll gladly help in any way we can - including watching you rehearse and providing feedback. 

Although we are happy to have out of town speakers, it's really important to the group to have representation of what is happening in Leeds, so if you are Leeds based and have a tale to share then please get in touch.

Just a quick note on the prickly subject of expenses, the meetup is organised by volunteers but are supported by the generosity of our sponsors. Unfortunately this means we don't have any funds to cover speaker expenses.

## Get In Touch

If you are interested in speaking or want to just run an idea past us then please get in touch via email or twitter (or talk to us at the next meetup).
