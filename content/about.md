## What is a Meetup ?

LeedsDevops is a technology meetup in Leeds about DevOps (you can see we thought long and hard about the name). It's a opportunity for a like minded people to get together and enjoy presentations about DevOps. There are many interpretations of DevOps, but we see it as the combination of technology, people and organisations easing the practice of getting code into production (and living there). Each meetup typically has two 40 minute talks about the aforemention topics, this could be a tutorial on using a technoligy or a case study sharing experiences and lessons learned.


## A Brief History of LeedsDevops

The meetup was formed back in the autumn of 2013, our first meetup was held in an upstairs room of the Brewery Tap in Leeds and attended by 6 people. Fast forward to 2019 and we've had over 40 meetups and had industry renowned speakers and many local practitioners sharing the work they are doing in Leeds. We typically give away 100+ tickets for each meetup and are usually snapped up by the community we have built within a few hours.
